# [World-Wide-Weather](https://weatherforecaster-app.netlify.app/)

World-wide-weather is a fully responsive web application built using Javascript and Vue as the web framework. Using geolocation to locate a users coordinates, it fetches data from external API's and provides users with current weather and a 7-day forecast based on their location co-ordinates. It also allows users to select from a country list and input an area of that country to get the current and seven day forecast for that search.

Created by Steve Vance, Chris Fraser and James Fraser.
