# [World-Wide-Weather](https://weatherforecaster-app.netlify.app/)

World-wide-weather is a fully responsive web application built using Javascript and Vue as the web framework. Using geolocation to locate a users coordinates, it fetches data from external API's and provides users with current weather and a 7-day forecast based on their location co-ordinates. It also allows users to select from a country list and input an area of that country to get the current and seven day forecast for that search.

Created by Steve Vance, Chris Fraser and James Fraser.

The application is hosted on netlify
